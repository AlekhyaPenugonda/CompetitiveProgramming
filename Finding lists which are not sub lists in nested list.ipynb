    "Given the array favoriteCompanies where favoriteCompanies[i] is the list of favorites companies for the ith person (indexed from 0).\n",

    "Return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorites companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.\n",
