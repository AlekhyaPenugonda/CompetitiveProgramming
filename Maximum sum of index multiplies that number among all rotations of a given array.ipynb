    "This method discusses the efficient solution which solves the problem in O(n) time. In the naive solution, the values were calculated for every rotation. So if that can be done in constant time then the complexity will decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach: The basic approach is to calculate the sum of new rotation from the previous rotations. This brings up a similarity where only the multipliers of first and last element change drastically and the multiplier of every other element increases or decreases by 1. So in this way, the sum of next rotation can be calculated from the sum of present rotation.\n",

    "Multiplier of arr[i-1] changes from 0 to n-1, i.e., arr[i-1] * (n-1) is added to current value.\n",
    "Multipliers of other terms is decremented by 1. i.e., (cum_sum â€“ arr[i-1]) is subtracted from current value where cum_sum is sum of all numbers.\n",

    "= 8. Shifting it by one will make it {2, 3, 1} and next value\n",
